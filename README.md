## My process

### Built with

-   SASS features
-   CSS custom properties
-   Flexbox
-   CSS Grid
-   Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I wouldn't say I encountered a lot of new mechanics but this project tested what I've learned so far and made me use it in new ways. For the first time I created a fully responsive navbar with animations and everything. It also hides on scroll and shows again if you scroll up.

### Continued development

This took me way more time than it should have I think. And despite that, I have no doubt that the code could use a lot of improvements and a better structure. I just don't know how to choose the right one! I am still a beginner, so some rigid one, used in professional settings is probably too much bloat for me but I feel like there's gotta be a faster, better way to do all of this. Maybe I just need to get to JS and CSS frameworks already.
